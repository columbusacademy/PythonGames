In order to test our ability to load games created with Python's pygame module on our arcade consoles, 
we've decided to create a simple CA themed video game.

This game, called "CAmaze" has three very simple levels named after the divisions at CA: lower school, 
middle school, and upper school. 

The player starts as an Explorer and graduates to 6th grade once they complete the first maze. When they 
complete the second maze, they graduate to upper school and take the role of freshman to navigate the 
third maze. 

Currently, all obstacles and the player are signified by simple boxes and a grid.
